# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 01, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 days of code and deliberate practice. Worked on JavaScript on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** JavaScript seems to be a lot like C++. Its a lot easier and way more user friendly than C++ but based on what I've learned so far, it seems like JavaScript can have security issues arise very easily.

**Today's Progress**: Started on HTML. Got a little more than halfway through the course.

**Thoughts**: HTML is a little tricky. It's easy in one sense but a pain in another. I had a little bit of trouble with classes and nested elements within elements, especially when it comes to nesting multiple elements inside of one element, but I was able to work it out and get through those issues.

### Day 1: May 02, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I wound up spending a little over 2 hours on freeCodeCamp today, working through the rest of html and getting almost halfway done with CSS.

**Thoughts** As I kept progressing through the lessons, it became easier to understand html and css. The same concepts I learned in OOP using C++ are there, just in a different format. I didn't even notice the transition from html to bootstrap. Everything just seemed to fit together and it all made sense. I want to do more, but I have other classes I need to work on as well. My goal now is to finish with bootstrap before OOP class tomorrow.
