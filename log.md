# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 01, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 days of code and deliberate practice. Worked on JavaScript on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** JavaScript seems to be a lot like C++. Its a lot easier and way more user friendly than C++ but based on what I've learned so far, it seems like JavaScript can have security issues arise very easily.

**Today's Progress**: Started on HTML. Got a little more than halfway through the course.

**Thoughts**: HTML is a little tricky. It's easy in one sense but a pain in another. I had a little bit of trouble with classes and nested elements within elements, especially when it comes to nesting multiple elements inside of one element, but I was able to work it out and get through those issues.

### Day 1: May 02, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I wound up spending a little over 2 hours on freeCodeCamp today, working through the rest of html and getting almost halfway done with CSS.

**Thoughts** As I kept progressing through the lessons, it became easier to understand html and css. The same concepts I learned in OOP using C++ are there, just in a different format. I didn't even notice the transition from html to bootstrap. Everything just seemed to fit together and it all made sense. I want to do more, but I have other classes I need to work on as well. My goal now is to finish with bootstrap before OOP class tomorrow.

### Day 2: May 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I'm almost all the way through JavaScript. Just a few more lessons and I can move on to OOFP.

**Thoughts** I didn't get to finish up bootstrap like I originally wanted but I learned a lot more of JavaScript that I thought I would so it equalled out. I started having some trouble with JavaScript and that's why it wound up taking up so much of my time tonight. I'm currently on loops in JS right now, and it's not too difficult but I am having some translation problems between the format I learned in C++ and JS. The logic is still definitely the same. I think my biggest problem is in trying to move to fast through the challenges. Most of my mistakes are due to overlooking some small detail. I think if I take my time I'll find myself making a lot fewer mistakes. And I haven't forgotten about bootstrap. I want to finish that and will tomorrow, as long as I have the time to.
