**Today's Progress**: Started 100 days of code and deliberate practice. Worked on JavaScript on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** JavaScript seems to be a lot like C++. Its a lot easier and way more user friendly than C++ but based on what I've learned so far, it seems like JavaScript can have security issues arise very easily.

**Today's Progress**: Started on HTML. Got a little more than halfway through the course.

**Thoughts**: HTML is a little tricky. It's easy in one sense but a pain in another. I had a little bit of trouble with classes and nested elements within elements, especially when it comes to nesting multiple elements inside of one element, but I was able to work it out and get through those issues.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
