# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 01, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 days of code and deliberate practice. Worked on JavaScript on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** JavaScript seems to be a lot like C++. Its a lot easier and way more user friendly than C++ but based on what I've learned so far, it seems like JavaScript can have security issues arise very easily.

### Day 0: May 01, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started on HTML. Got a little more than halfway through the course.

**Thoughts**: HTML is a little tricky. It's easy in one sense but a pain in another. I had a little bit of trouble with classes and nested elements within elements, especially when it comes to nesting multiple elements inside of one element, but I was able to work it out and get through those issues.

### Day 1: May 02, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I wound up spending a little over 2 hours on freeCodeCamp today, working through the rest of html and getting almost halfway done with CSS.

**Thoughts** As I kept progressing through the lessons, it became easier to understand html and css. The same concepts I learned in OOP using C++ are there, just in a different format. I didn't even notice the transition from html to bootstrap. Everything just seemed to fit together and it all made sense. I want to do more, but I have other classes I need to work on as well. My goal now is to finish with bootstrap before OOP class tomorrow.

### Day 2: May 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I'm almost all the way through JavaScript. Just a few more lessons and I can move on to OOFP.

**Thoughts** I didn't get to finish up bootstrap like I originally wanted but I learned a lot more of JavaScript that I thought I would so it equalled out. I started having some trouble with JavaScript and that's why it wound up taking up so much of my time tonight. I'm currently on loops in JS right now, and it's not too difficult but I am having some translation problems between the format I learned in C++ and JS. The logic is still definitely the same. I think my biggest problem is in trying to move to fast through the challenges. Most of my mistakes are due to overlooking some small detail. I think if I take my time I'll find myself making a lot fewer mistakes. And I haven't forgotten about bootstrap. I want to finish that and will tomorrow, as long as I have the time to.


### Day 3: May 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I got into the OOP part of JS today.

**Thoughts** There was one part in the Basic JS section that I had to give up on today and it was really disheartening. I spent close to an hour on that one problem alone and I was never able to clear more than two of the test cases. I checked with some of my class mates to see if they were able to make any headway on it and no one I heard from had been able to clear that problem. I wound up skipping it and continuing on into the OOP part of JS but it's still aggrevating that I had to skip over a problem. I made more progress on the bootstrap section but didn't finish it yet. I'll prob finish that up tomorrow. Hopefully someone will have solved the problem I was having difficulty with and will help me to understand what I'm missing. Either way, tomorrow I'm going to finish OOP for JS and bootstrap and continue on to Basic Algorithm and Scripting. My goal is to make it at least half-way through that section tomorrow, assuming it's not going to be too difficult. Maybe I can even finish that section too. The Profile Lookup problem still bothers me though. I'll eventually get it. I'll wind up looking at it every day. No idea when I'll get it but I can't just leave it unfinished. I want to figure it out VERY badly.


### Day 4: May 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the OOP part of JS and moved into algorithms.

**Thoughts** Fist off, one of my class mates figured out the profile lookup lesson so I looked at her example an saw what I had gotten right in my code and where I was going wrong. I corrected my code and got that lesson completed. I also made it through the OOP of JS and moved into the algorithms. So far they are a little challenging. More challenging than what I originally thought, but not too bad. I've gotten through the first few problems so far but those three alone took almost an hour whereas most of the OOP part took only about 40 min so it's gonna take me a little longer than I thought, but that's ok. More time on the algorithms means I'm spending more time thinking about how to effectively solve the problems. I'm gonna set a goal to get through no less than 4 of them each day. And if I spend 1.5 - 2 hrs for 4 problems then I'll be able to get through the algorithms section in much less than the 50 hrs it says it takes. I just need to pace myself. Hopefully by monday I'll be done with, or almost done with the algorithms section.
