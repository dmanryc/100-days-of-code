# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 01, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started 100 days of code and deliberate practice. Worked on JavaScript on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** JavaScript seems to be a lot like C++. Its a lot easier and way more user friendly than C++ but based on what I've learned so far, it seems like JavaScript can have security issues arise very easily.

### Day 0: May 01, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started on HTML. Got a little more than halfway through the course.

**Thoughts**: HTML is a little tricky. It's easy in one sense but a pain in another. I had a little bit of trouble with classes and nested elements within elements, especially when it comes to nesting multiple elements inside of one element, but I was able to work it out and get through those issues.

### Day 1: May 02, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I wound up spending a little over 2 hours on freeCodeCamp today, working through the rest of html and getting almost halfway done with CSS.

**Thoughts** As I kept progressing through the lessons, it became easier to understand html and css. The same concepts I learned in OOP using C++ are there, just in a different format. I didn't even notice the transition from html to bootstrap. Everything just seemed to fit together and it all made sense. I want to do more, but I have other classes I need to work on as well. My goal now is to finish with bootstrap before OOP class tomorrow.

### Day 2: May 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I'm almost all the way through JavaScript. Just a few more lessons and I can move on to OOFP.

**Thoughts** I didn't get to finish up bootstrap like I originally wanted but I learned a lot more of JavaScript that I thought I would so it equalled out. I started having some trouble with JavaScript and that's why it wound up taking up so much of my time tonight. I'm currently on loops in JS right now, and it's not too difficult but I am having some translation problems between the format I learned in C++ and JS. The logic is still definitely the same. I think my biggest problem is in trying to move to fast through the challenges. Most of my mistakes are due to overlooking some small detail. I think if I take my time I'll find myself making a lot fewer mistakes. And I haven't forgotten about bootstrap. I want to finish that and will tomorrow, as long as I have the time to.


### Day 3: May 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I got into the OOP part of JS today.

**Thoughts** There was one part in the Basic JS section that I had to give up on today and it was really disheartening. I spent close to an hour on that one problem alone and I was never able to clear more than two of the test cases. I checked with some of my class mates to see if they were able to make any headway on it and no one I heard from had been able to clear that problem. I wound up skipping it and continuing on into the OOP part of JS but it's still aggrevating that I had to skip over a problem. I made more progress on the bootstrap section but didn't finish it yet. I'll prob finish that up tomorrow. Hopefully someone will have solved the problem I was having difficulty with and will help me to understand what I'm missing. Either way, tomorrow I'm going to finish OOP for JS and bootstrap and continue on to Basic Algorithm and Scripting. My goal is to make it at least half-way through that section tomorrow, assuming it's not going to be too difficult. Maybe I can even finish that section too. The Profile Lookup problem still bothers me though. I'll eventually get it. I'll wind up looking at it every day. No idea when I'll get it but I can't just leave it unfinished. I want to figure it out VERY badly.


### Day 4: May 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the OOP part of JS and moved into algorithms.

**Thoughts** Fist off, one of my class mates figured out the profile lookup lesson so I looked at her example an saw what I had gotten right in my code and where I was going wrong. I corrected my code and got that lesson completed. I also made it through the OOP of JS and moved into the algorithms. So far they are a little challenging. More challenging than what I originally thought, but not too bad. I've gotten through the first few problems so far but those three alone took almost an hour whereas most of the OOP part took only about 40 min so it's gonna take me a little longer than I thought, but that's ok. More time on the algorithms means I'm spending more time thinking about how to effectively solve the problems. I'm gonna set a goal to get through no less than 4 of them each day. And if I spend 1.5 - 2 hrs for 4 problems then I'll be able to get through the algorithms section in much less than the 50 hrs it says it takes. I just need to pace myself. Hopefully by monday I'll be done with, or almost done with the algorithms section.


### Day 5: May 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 of the algorithms section.

**Thoughts** The three problems I completed today took me a lot longer than I anticipated they would. I tried using the pomodoro method while completing these challenges but after the first hour I didn't take another break until I completed the third challenge. That took me almost until the third hour mark. I took about 30 min off and came back to attempt the fourth challenge I wanted to complete today but after three failed attempts I decided to call it a night. I'm just completely frustrated at this point and I know I'm not gonna be able to really focus with a clear head until tomorrow. The first two challenges really gave me a hard time, the second one especially so. To solve it, I wound up having to research and learn more about JS's Regular Expressions. In hind sight, the first problem wasn't too bad. I just needed to studying up on some of JS's string functions. But that second problem today.....I can't say enough how much of a hard time it gave me. Especially trying to learn some of the regexp that I needed to solve it. I'm still a little confused by exactly what all of the regexp's can do, but I was able to piece together enough understanding to get the problem done. The third problem I did today, was just finding the largest number in several different arrays and putting those numbers into their own array and then displaying it. It took me a little bit of time to uncoil my brain from the capitalize all first letters problem(second one I keep talking about), but once I realized I didn't need any JS specific knowledge to solve it, I was able to knock that out pretty quickly. Quicker than the first and second anyways. So far, my knowledge of C++ has come in decently handy. Like I said, the third problem today I was able to solve using knowledge I gained in c++ but that second one.......I need to study JS more, and practice those regexp's. I have a feeling I'm gonna be needing to use those more and more as I continue on with the algorithms. But not tonight. My brain is fried.


### Day 6: May 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Achieved goal of completing four algorithm problems.

**Thoughts** I'm gladd I decided to call it a night when I did last night. It gave me time to relax and unwind and attack these problems fresh today, which I was able to do. I spent about 30 min reviewing the regexp's like I wanted, took a little break, came back and reviewed some of the different string functions that JS uses for almost an hour, took the afternoon off to take care of some chores, came back and reviewed again really quickly, ate dinner, and got on to start my pomodoro. In total, I spent a little over 3 1/2 hrs on the computer today, just for 4 problems, but I fear that if I had not taken that extra two hours throughout the day to review and study, I might not have made it through the first two that I completed today. They each took a little bit of time with some trial and error, but I really believe that because I took the extra time to prepare, I was able to reach my goal within my desired time limit. Not only is it important to do a little bit of coding every day, it's also important to find out what my weaknesses are and then spend extra time reviewing those concepts I'm weak on so that when I need to use them, I'm prepared and ready. I going to try and spend a little extra time tomorrow before I start coding to review and study again so I can be prepared for the next set of challenges and hopefully will meet my goal for the day. I've also decided that I want to continue with the 100 days of coding, to make sure I don't lose knowledge, over the course of the summer, and I want to see if I can complete all of the code camp website by the time I complete my 100 days of coding. I need this practice and following through with the 100 days would be a great excuse to continue studying and practicing.


### Day 7: May 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished bootstrap and one more basic algorithm problem.

**Thoughts** So I took it a little light tonight. Lighter than all of my previous nights so far anyway. I finished up bootstrap and did one more problem on the basic algorithms section. It was the Slasher Flick problem and I blew right through it. The next one, Mutations, started to give me a little bit of trouble so I decided to go ahead and call it a night early. I'm gonna have to do that for the rest of the week too since this is the last week of the spring semester and I need to focus of studying for my finals. But even with finals all week, I still consider tonight a success simply because I made it a point to not only get online and spend at least an hour practicing, but I also kept up with this log, and it's no longer a requirement. Tomorrow, since I still have my OOP class to study for, I will keep it light again and I only plan on doing some of the jQuery section. At least half would be good I think, unless I start flying through it, then I'll just finish it. And I'll take a look at the next algorithm problem but I'm not going to spend too much time on it. Once this week is over though, I'm going to be making sure I get at least 2 hours in every day.
